 USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:                                                                                    
 To run the installer, open terminal, and type `bash installerHCA1.bash' within currently installed-to folder. Make sure your terminal window has already been maximized to FULL SCREEN.
                                                                                                        
 ABOUT:                                                                                                 
 A simple Bash script put together by H:CA Student Joe Coviello which installs certain useful packages, and is particularly useful after a fresh install. It also contains optional system tweaks for enhancing general ease of use, and comfort.                        
                                                                                                       
NOTES:                                                                                                 
-Read this whole file over once, first, before executing it. In your doing so,
 you may wish to comment out any unwanted package(s) by simply adding a "#" to the beginning of each respective line.          
-The OS Optimization script is only for Linux at this time. Furthermore, it can only be run ONE TIME due to file changes being repeated otherwise. Do not interrupt the installer. Using '-t' more than once will damage your system!         
-On your local desktop: look for the appearance of several related post-install README files. These contain useful documentation you'll be using to help get you started with your cohort.
