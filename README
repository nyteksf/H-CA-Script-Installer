 ABOUT:                                                                                                 
 A simple Bash script put together by H:CA Student Joe Coviello which installs certain
useful packages, and for particularly after completing a fresh install. It also
contains optional system tweaks for enhancing general ease of use, and comfort.                        
                                                                                                       
NOTES:                                                                                                 
-Read over this whole file once, first, before executing it. In your doing so,
 you may wish to comment out any unwanted package(s) by simply adding a "#" to the
beginning of each respective line.          
-The OS Optimization script is only for Linux at this time. Furthermore, it can only
be run ONE TIME due to file changes being repeated otherwise. Using -t more than once 
will damage your system.         
-On your local desktop: look for the appearance of several related post-install README files.
