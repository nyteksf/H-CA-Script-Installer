# HACKER: CODING ACADEMY BASH SCRIPT

## CREATES STANDARDIZED CODING ENVIRONMENT PLUS

### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:                                                                          
 To run the install script, students operating Linux and OSX should open terminal, and type 'bash installerHCA.bash' in the currently installed-to folder. Make sure your terminal window has already been maximized to FULL SCREEN to clearly read all of the messages involved in the installation and set up process.
                                                                                                        
### ABOUT:                                                                                                 
 This is a Bash script written and put together by H:CA Student Joe Coviello as a side project for the same institution. It automagically installs certain useful packages to set up a uniform programming environment; the which we formerly had to install ourselves. With that said, it is particularly useful for saving time after a fresh install. This script also additionally contains optional system tweaks for sake of enhancing general ease of use, performance and comfort. All modified files are automatically backed up.                        
                                                                                                       
### NOTES:                                       
-On your local desktop you may at the end look for the appearance of several related README files. These contain useful documentation you'll be using to help get you started off properly and quickly with the rest of your cohort. 
-Read the whole bash file over once, first, before executing it. In doing so you may very well find that you wish to comment out any unwanted and unnecessary package(s) simply by adding a "#" to the beginning of each respective line.          
-WARNING: The OS Optimization subscript is only included for Linux users at this time. Furthermore, it must be noted that it can only be run ONE TIME due to system file changes being made. Do not interrupt this section of the installer! I repeat: using '-t' more than once will damage your system files!
