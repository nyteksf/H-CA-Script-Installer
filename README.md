# HACKER: CODING ACADEMY BASH SCRIPT

## CREATES STANDARDIZED CODING ENVIRONMENT PLUS

### ABOUT:                                                                                                 
 This is a Bash script written and put together by H:CA Student Joe Coviello as a side project for the same institution. It automagically installs certain useful packages to set up a uniform programming environment; the which we formerly had to install ourselves. With that said, it is particularly useful for saving time after a fresh install. This script also additionally contains optional system tweaks for sake of enhancing general ease of use, performance and comfort. All modified files are automatically backed up.

### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:                                                                          
 To run, students operating Linux and OSX should open terminal, and at the prompt type *'bash installerHCA.bash'* in its currently installed-to folder. Make sure your terminal window has already been maximized to FULL SCREEN to allow all of the messages involved in the installation and set up process to be clearly seen and understood.                                             
 
 
### NOTES:                                       
-On your local desktop you may look for the appearance of several related README files generated at the end. These will be found to contain useful documentation; the which will get your whole cohort rapidly up to speed. 

-Be sure to read the whole bash file over once before executing it. In doing so you may very well find out that you wish to comment out certain package(s). Accomplish this simply by adding a "#" to the beginning of each respectively desired line.   
e.g., <i>"# curl ..."</i>

-WARNING: The OS Optimization subscript is only available for Linux users at this time. Should work on Ubunto and Debian for some time to come. Furthermore, it must be noted that it must itself only be run ONCE due to the system file changes being made. Do not interrupt this section of the installer if it has been selected! I repeat: using option '-t' more than one time will corrupt your system files! If this should occur, then simply rename the backups found in their same folders back to their originals by removing the file suffix '.bak' therefrom.
