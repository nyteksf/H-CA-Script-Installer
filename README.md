# HACKER: CODING ACADEMY BASH INSTALL SCRIPT

 [u]USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:[/u]                                                                                    
 To run the install script, students using Linux and OSX should open terminal and type 'bash installerHCA.bash' in its currently installed-to folder. Make sure your terminal window has already been maximized to FULL SCREEN.

 A simple Bash script written and put together by H:CA Student Joe Coviello. It automagically installs certain useful packages to set up a uniform programming environment, and is particularly useful to save time with after completing a fresh install. This script also contains optional system tweaks for enhancing general ease of use, performance and comfort.                        
                                                                                                       
 NOTES:                                       
-On your local desktop: look for the appearance of several related post-install README files. These contain useful documentation you'll be using to help get you started with your cohort. 
-Read the whole file over once, first, before executing it. In your doing so, you may find you wish to comment out any unwanted and unnecessary package(s) by simply adding a "#" to the beginning of each respective line.          
-WARNING: The OS Optimization subscript is only included for Linux users at this time. Furthermore, note that it can only be run ONE TIME due to system file changes. Do not interrupt this section of the installer! I repeat: using '-t' more than once will damage your system!
