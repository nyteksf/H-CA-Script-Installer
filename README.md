# HACKER: CODING ACADEMY BASH SCRIPT

## CREATES STANDARDIZED CODING ENVIRONMENT PLUS

### ABOUT:                                                                                                 
 This is a Bash script written and put together by H:CA Student Joe Coviello as a side project for the same institution. It automagically installs certain useful packages to set up a uniform programming environment; the which we formerly had to install ourselves. With that said, it is particularly useful for saving time after a fresh install. This script also additionally contains optional system tweaks for sake of enhancing general ease of use, performance and comfort. All modified files are automatically backed up.

### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:                                                                          
 To run, students operating Linux or OSX should open terminal, and at the prompt type *'bash installerHCA.bash'* in its currently installed-to folder. Make sure your terminal window has already been maximized to FULL SCREEN to allow all of the messages involved in the installation and set up process to be clearly seen and understood, or even to best enjoy the streaming ASCII art.                                             
 
 
### NOTES:                                       
-On your local desktop you may look for the appearance of several related README files generated at the end. These will be found to contain useful documentation; the which will get your whole cohort rapidly up to speed. 

-Be sure to read the whole bash file over once before its execution. In doing so you may very well find out that you wish to comment out certain package(s). An example would be if for some crazy reason a person just happened to prefer emacs over vim and wanted to avoid the installation. That person would be able to accomplish it by adding a "#" to the beginning of each related line.   
e.g., <i>"# curl ..."</i>

-WARNING: The OS Optimization subscript is only available for Linux users at this time. Furthermore, this option should only be run ONCE due to the system file changes made. Do not interrupt this section of the installer if it has been selected! I repeat: using option '-t' more than one time will corrupt your system files! If this should occur, then simply rename the most recent backups to their original filenames by removing the file suffix '.bak' therefrom.
